Open data pathway is a self-assessment tool that will help you assess how well your organisation publishes and consumes open data, and identify actions for improvement.

The tool uses a questionnaire based on the open data maturity model. The model is based around five themes and and five progress levels. Each theme represents a broad area of operations within an organisation. Each theme is then broken down into areas of activity.
